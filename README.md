Topic: Web application that fetches starwars characters from starwars api and displays fetched character
name and some other information. Im creating a homeview where you can view starwars 
characters fetched by id and you can add any of those characters to a list. The list is shown on another page called viewcontent where you can delete characters which were added on
the homeview page.
Im going to use React Router for this assignment and it will be published on heroku in the future.


Heroku link: will be added later on
